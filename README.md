# WorldWise

A note-taking app that uses Leaflet.js to track countries you want to visit or have already visited, designed to practice real-world React development.

## What I've Learned

- **RESTful API Basics**: Handling POST and DELETE requests with a JSON server (fake API).
- **Leaflet Functions**: Utilizing various Leaflet functionalities for mapping.
- **useSearchParams**: Extracting search parameters as an alternative to useState.
- **using npmjs.com**: Utilizing a package.
- **Nested Routes**: Implementing nested routes with React Router.

Feel free to dive into the codebase to see these concepts applied in practice!
